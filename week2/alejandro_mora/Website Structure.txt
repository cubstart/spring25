    -> A fun twist on a typical “Projects” page, but instead of just polished work, you also include failures, weird mistakes, or learning moments.
    -> A self-aware “404 Error” page could also fit here, with fake "glitchy" messages about your creative journey.

4. Blog/Current Events in life - Share thoughts, tutorials, or experiences.

7. “Playlist of My Life”
    -> A page featuring a curated playlist with songs that inspire your work, along with short explanations for each song.

9. The Scrapbook (Ideas and Experiments)

Home Page: Pixel Art Scrolling Background
    -> Concept: Create a pixel art cityscape, landscape, or retro video game world that scrolls as the user navigates down the page.
    -> Retro Vibe: Use 8-bit or 16-bit style graphics—think Super Mario Bros. or Zelda. As they scroll, different elements of the "scene" could change or animate (like clouds moving, buildings appearing, or characters running across the screen).
    -> Dynamic Element: Add parallax scrolling so the background and foreground move at different speeds, enhancing the retro experience.
